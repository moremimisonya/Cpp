**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

The Airgead Banking project required that I build a program that allowed investors to see what their initial investment would look like with and without continuous deposits over time at a fixed interest rate.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think the pseudocode, the orderliness of the code, the naming conventions, and the visual of the end product were particularly well done.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

I believe the only thing I could have done to enhance the code was to use a switch for the menu options for efficiency's sake. I think maybe that was the only thing.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

The main() class was the greatest challenge I faced while building this program. I left it and returned after a break, took a deep breath, re-checked what I had done, and sought assistance in a couple of instances where I was stuck. The resource I have to offer is a practice site: www.coderbyte.com

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?**
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

The use of object-oriented programming, in-line comments, and whitespaces are particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework and also make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
